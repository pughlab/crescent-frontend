            CanceR Single Cell ExpressioN Toolkit (CReSCENT) is a scalable and standardized set of novel algorithmic
            methods, tools, and a data portal deployed on cloud computing infrastructure. To allow comparison of cells
            in cancerous and healthy tissues, the system will aggregate single-cell genomic data generated by cancer
            researchers and connect them to international reference data generated by experts from around the world.
            This data sharing and aggregation system is a key differentiating factor in CReSCENT that will increase
            researcher productivity by accelerating execution and comparison of computational methods, as well as
            providing contextual data for understanding how cells behave within tumour tissues. CReSCENT is available
            under an open source license via{" "}
