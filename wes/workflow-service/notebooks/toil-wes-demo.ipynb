    "This notebook is meant to contain all of the necessary parts needed to install and run the [Workflow Execution Service](https://github.com/ga4gh/workflow-execution-service-schemas) backed by [UCSC Toil](https://toil.readthedocs.io/en/3.15.0/) on a linux compliant system with Python installed!\n",
    "\n",
    "The Workflow Execution Service attempts to present the interface for workflow execution over HTTP methods. Simple JSON requests including the inputs and outputs for a workflow are sent to a service. This allows us to \"ship code to the data,\" since data privacy and egress costs require that data is not shared.\n",
    "\n",
    "UCSC Toil is software for executing workflows. It presents a Python native API, which will not be demonstrated here, as well as a CWL compliant CLI interface. For that reason, any CWLRunner can easily be exposed by the workflow-service, demonstrated here.\n",
