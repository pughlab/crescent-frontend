            CanceR Single Cell ExpressioN Toolkit (CReSCENT) is a scalable and standardized set of single-cell algorithmic methods, tools, and data portal deployed on high-performance computing infrastructure. To allow comparison of cells in cancerous and healthy tissues, the system will aggregate single-cell genomic data generated by cancer researchers and connect them to international reference data generated by experts from around the world. This data sharing and aggregation system is a key differentiating factor in CReSCENT that will increase researcher productivity by accelerating execution and comparison of computational methods, as well as providing contextual data for understanding how cells behave within tumour tissues. CReSCENT is available under an open source license via <a href='https://github.com/pughlab/crescent/blob/master/LICENSE' target='_blank' rel="noopener noreferrer">Github.</a>
